Portfolio Excel Sheet: 
This project applies principles of modern portfolio theory and asset pricing to evaluate the risk and return characteristics of a two-asset equity portfolio. Using historical market data, the analysis calculates daily and annualized returns, volatility, correlation, and beta for each asset, and estimates expected returns using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Portfolio-level metrics, including expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio, are then computed across different asset weightings to assess diversification effects and risk-adjusted performance.

The project emphasizes practical portfolio construction and risk evaluation, illustrating how asset correlation, market sensitivity, and return expectations interact to influence portfolio outcomes. By combining statistical analysis, regression-based beta estimation, and simulation techniques, the model demonstrates how quantitative tools can be used to support informed investment decisions and evaluate trade-offs between risk and return in equity portfolios.
