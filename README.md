Projects from Kelly's academic and professional development. 

This project builds a comprehensive financial model for Ingevity Corporation (NGVT) to assess operating performance, financial health, and intrinsic value. The model integrates historical financial statement analysis with forward-looking projections across the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, using margin trends, revenue segmentation, and cost structure assumptions. A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation supported by a WACC calculation and sensitivity analysis evaluates key value drivers and risk factors, demonstrating applied skills in financial modeling, forecasting, and corporate valuation.
