Projects from Kelly's academic and professional development. 

Final Modeling Project: 
This project analyzes the risk and return characteristics of a two-asset portfolio using principles from modern portfolio theory and asset pricing. Using historical price data for Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) and Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY), the model calculates daily holding period returns, annualized expected returns, and volatility for each stock. Expected returns are estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), incorporating market returns, beta, and the risk-free rate. The project further evaluates the relationship between the two assets by computing correlation and constructing portfolio-level expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio across different weight combinations.

The results show meaningful differences in risk behavior and market sensitivity between the two firms. Regression analysis indicates that ODFL exhibits a stronger relationship with market movements, while JKHY displays lower explanatory power and more idiosyncratic behavior. Due to ODFL’s negative expected return and higher volatility over the sample period, the optimal risky portfolio is heavily weighted toward JKHY. Monte Carlo simulations using a geometric Brownian motion framework further illustrate the distribution of potential future price paths, highlighting the impact of volatility and expected return assumptions on long-term outcomes. Overall, the project demonstrates how expected returns, correlation, and volatility interact to drive portfolio construction and risk-adjusted performance.


Portfolio Excel Sheet: 
This project applies principles of modern portfolio theory and asset pricing to evaluate the risk and return characteristics of a two-asset equity portfolio. Using historical market data, the analysis calculates daily and annualized returns, volatility, correlation, and beta for each asset, and estimates expected returns using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Portfolio-level metrics, including expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio, are then computed across different asset weightings to assess diversification effects and risk-adjusted performance.

The project emphasizes practical portfolio construction and risk evaluation, illustrating how asset correlation, market sensitivity, and return expectations interact to influence portfolio outcomes. By combining statistical analysis, regression-based beta estimation, and simulation techniques, the model demonstrates how quantitative tools can be used to support informed investment decisions and evaluate trade-offs between risk and return in equity portfolios.

TimeValueOfMoney:
TimeValueOfMoney.xlsx is an Excel workbook designed to apply and reinforce core time value of money concepts through structured, calculation-based worksheets. The file includes practical exercises involving present value and future value calculations, annuities, discounting, and compounding across different time horizons and interest rates. It emphasizes accurate financial modeling in Excel and serves as a foundational tool for understanding valuation, capital budgeting, and broader applications in finance coursework and analysis.

Bond:
Bond_Kelly_Wenzel.xlsx is an Excel workbook focused on fixed-income analysis, combining theoretical concepts with applied financial modeling. It includes structured worksheets covering bond pricing, yield calculations, duration and convexity, immunization strategies, and yield curve analysis, along with practice problems and an academic assignment. The file emphasizes practical use of Excel to evaluate bond values, interest rate sensitivity, and risk management techniques commonly used in fixed-income investing.

These projects were done through my Financial Modeling class at USF.
